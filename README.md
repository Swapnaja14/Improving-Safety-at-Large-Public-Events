This is my 2nd year 1st semester EDI project based on Image Processing-
#Improving Safety at Large Public Events

Tasks performed

1. Extract frames from videos (Using OpenCV)
We have three types of videos for three kinds of labels- safe, stampede, dense

2. Resize the safe videos into 640x640 format with YOLO compatibility (Using OpenCV)

3. Sharpen blur images (Using OpenCV)

4. Brighten dark images for better accuracy (Using OpenCV)
